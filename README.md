# HydraNets Subtask Partitioning

This code implements the subtask partitioning algorithm described by the
[HydraNets](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Mullapudi_HydraNets_Specialized_Dynamic_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)
paper (Mullapudi, et al). It was originally designed to partition the ImageNet
dataset.

To set up the virtual environment, run:
```bash
$ python3 -m venv <path/to/virtualenv>
$ source <path/to/virtualenv/>/bin/activate
```

If your local repository already has a virtual environment, you skip the
creation step and just activate that one.

After setting up your virtual environment, install the required dependencies by
running:
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
